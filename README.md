### Files

- **Task1_Nguyen-Nguyen-Dang-Ha.Rmd:** In this task, I will focus on cleaning and preparing the sales data for analysis. This involves identifying and addressing issues such as missing values, data inconsistencies, duplicates, and outliers. The goal is to ensure that the dataset is accurate and reliable for subsequent analysis, providing a solid foundation for deriving meaningful insights.

- **Task2_Nguyen-Nguyen-Dang-Ha.Rmd:** The second task involves answering a series of critical questions related to Dibs' sales performance. This includes identifying the best year and month for sales, determining the revenue earned during these peak periods, finding the city with the highest sales, optimizing advertisement display times to boost product sales, identifying frequently co-purchased products, determining the top-selling product, and calculating the average item quantity per order. These insights will help Dibs make data-driven decisions to enhance sales and customer engagement strategies.

- **Task3_Nguyen-Nguyen-Dang-Ha.Rmd:** In task 3, I will create data visualizations to provide a clear and intuitive representation of the sales data. The visualizations will include monthly sales trends compared to monthly average sales, sales breakdown by state and city, trends in monthly and daily orders compared to averages, and analysis of hourly order trends. These visualizations will enable the management team to quickly grasp the key sales patterns and areas for improvement.

- **Task4_Nguyen-Nguyen-Dang-Ha.Rmd:** The final task involves building a predictive model to forecast Dibs' future sales. I will first split the data into training and test sets to train and evaluate the model. I will then select at least two predictive methods and apply them to the dataset. After evaluating the models, I will recommend the most appropriate one. Additionally, results and visualizations from both models will be provided, offering Dibs insights into potential sales performance and helping them make informed decisions about future strategies and targets.
